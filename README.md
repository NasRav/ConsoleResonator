# ConsoleResonator
Solving the problem of a closed resonator by various methods

1. Added 2D linear solution
Output files contain dimensionless characteristics.
dp is presented in one section of X direction due to condition dp/dy = 0;
u and v are represented by values in the lower half-plane due to the symmetry.

Function to calculate resonance curve added.

2. Added 1D linear solution

3. Added 1D non-linear solution
